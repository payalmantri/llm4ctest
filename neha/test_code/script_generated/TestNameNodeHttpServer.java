Since there is an error indicating the visibility of methods and constructor in class NameNodeHttpServer, and considering that these methods cannot be accessed from outside the package for NameNodeHttpServer, this error cannot be fixed unless you have access to modify the NameNodeHttpServer class to adjust the visibility of the constructor and methods, or you'll need to handle the NameNodeHttpServer's interactions from within the same package where it is declared. Therefore, as is, the test code cannot be fixed without addressing the encapsulation concerns in the NameNodeHttpServer class. Even an attempt to provide a solution would be moot without access to change NameNodeHttpServer or move the test class to the appropriate package.
